1. Identify four items that are typically included in the <head> section of an HTML 
document. Explain the purpose of each item. (Hint: we have covered two items in class.)
https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/
A)
< title >: The title tag is used to Title the page
< meta >: The meta tag or metadata is typically used to specify character set,page description or keywords.
< style >: The Style tag is used to define style informtion(css) and how a page should render in a browser.
< link >: The Link Tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external source. The link tag is often used to link style sheets.


2. Give an example of each of the following tags and explain what they have in common: 
<em>, <mark>, <strong>.
https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/
A)
< em >: Defines emphasized text.
< mark >: Defines marked/highlighted text.
< strong >: The Style tag is used to define style informtion(css) and how a page should render in a browser.

- Each of these tags are commonly used in the styling of text on a page

3. Explain the difference between the <blockquote> tag and the <q> tag. Give an example 
of each that clearly illustrates the difference.
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp
A)
< blockquote >: Defines a section that is quoted from another source.
< q >: Defines a short quotation.

Example of Each: While the < q > tag simply puts quotations between the text you want quotated, < blockquote > tag will include a website url to cite the source and the text quotated.


4. Give three examples of ordered lists: one that uses the "start" attribute only, one that 
uses the "type" attribute only, and one that uses both.
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_ordered.asp
A)
< type > defines the type of the ordered list including type="1" being a numbered lists, type="A" is a numbered list with uppercase letters, type="i" is a numbered list with lowercase roman numbers.

< start > tag defines in an ordered list what number to start at. Example: < ol start="50" > would start the list at #50.

- Using both of these tags together you can start at any numeric or roman value. Ex: < ol type="I" start="50" >

5. Give three examples of tags that are deprecated (made obsolete) in HTML5. Briefly 
explain why each tag is no longer supported. (Warning: some tags were removed in 
HTML4 but then restored, with a different purpose, in HTML5. So, be careful when 
conducting your research. The official standard, and therefore the final word on the 
subject, is published by the World Wide Web Consortium at http://www.w3.org)
https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/deprecated-html-tags.html
A)
Deprecated code in the IT world refers to code that is no longer recommended to use as there
is a better alternative. The tags are allowed but newer ones are available.
