                source and the text quotated.

            <b>Question  #4:</b> Give three examples of ordered lists: one that uses the "start" attribute only, one that
            uses the "type" attribute only, and one that uses both.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    < type > defines the type of the ordered list including type="1" being a numbered lists, type="A" is a numbered list with uppercase letters,
                    type="i" is a numbered list with lowercase roman numbers.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    < start > tag defines in an ordered list what number to start at. Example: < ol start="50" > would start the list at #50.
                </li>
                <br>
                - Using both of these tags together you can start at any numeric or roman value. Ex: < ol type="I" start="50" >

            <b>Question  #5:</b> Give three examples of tags that are deprecated (made obsolete) in HTML5. Briefly
            explain why each tag is no longer supported.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Answer #5:</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            Deprecated code in the IT world refers to code that is no longer recommended to use as there
            is a better alternative. The tags are allowed but newer ones are available.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    < menu > was replaced with < ul > and defines where to open a link.
                </li>
                <li>
                    < isindex > was replaced with < form > and is used to display search strings in the current document its in.

                <li>
                    < applet > was replaced with < object > and is used to define embedded Java applet.

            <b>Question  #9:</b> Explain thoroughly why HTML5 supports the < small > tag but not the < big > tag.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Answer #9:</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason the < big > tag is no longer used in HTML5 and the < small > tag still is, is because the < small > tag still had relevant use with footnotes or copyright tags, while < big > already
            had many similar tags to it such as < h1 > < h2 > etc, so it was no longer needed.
