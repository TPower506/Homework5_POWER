            <h1>P</h1>
            <p>The &#60;p&#62; tag is the primary tag used for displaying basic text
                to the user. It displays by default the same way text without a tag shows up.

        <div>
            <h1>A</h1>
            <p>the &#60;a&#62; tag is used to create links to other websites, pages, or elements.


                The href attribute is required in order for the link to lead anywhere. The text 
                between the opening and closing tag is what is actually displayed to the user.

        <div>
            <h1>IMG</h1>
            <p>The &lt;img&#62; tag is the primary tag used for displaying an image or media on
                a webpage. The src attribute is required and controls what file will be displayed.
                The img tag is one of a handful of tags that do not have a closing statement.
                One of the other attributes that is very good and common practice is the alt
                attribute. This attribute will control the text a user sees if they hover over
                the image or the image doesn't load correctly for them.
            </p>
            <img src="src/image.jpg" alt="This is an image"><br>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>h1-6</h1>
            <p>The &#60;h1-6&#62; tags are another element used to display text, however the text
                is generally larger and bolder. It is meant to provide a series of font changes to
                make highlighting certain information easier to do. 1 is the largest header, 6 is the smallest.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><h1>h1 example</h1></li>
                <li><h2>h2 example</h2></li>
                <li><h3>h3 example</h3></li>
                <li><h4>h4 example</h4></li>
                <li><h5>h5 example</h5></li>
                <li><h6>h6 example</h6></li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>OL</h1>
            <p>The &#60;ol&#62; tag is used to create an ordered list of items (incrementing with
                each item). To add an item to it, all you have to do is surround any HTML element in
                &#60;li&#62; tags.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>Second item</li>
                <li>Third item</li>
            </ol>
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp">w3schools article</a>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>UL</h1>
            <p>The &#60;ul&#62; tag is used to create an unordered list of items that are
                displayed with bullet points. To add an item to it, all you have to do is 
                surround any HTML element in &#60;li&#62; tags.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>Second item</li>
                <li>Third item</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>BR</h1>
            <p>The &#60;br&#62; tag is used to create a line break in the page, forcing
                all new elements down into the next row. In some (not necessarily good)
                cases, &#60;br&#62; tags are used to position elements vertically on the
                page.
            </p>
            <p>This sentence will be interupted <br>and shoved to the next line by 
                a &#60;br&#62;
            </p>
