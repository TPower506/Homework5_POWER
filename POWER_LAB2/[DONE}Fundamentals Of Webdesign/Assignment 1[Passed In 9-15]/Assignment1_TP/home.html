<h1 style="font-size:40px;"> <u>- Japan - </u></h1>
<p>I really want to visit Japan as I recently became very interested in the culture and what is has to offer when I 
    first started watching a streamer who streamed himself walking and cycling the streets both at day and night.
    During the daytime the streets are packed tight with thousands of people working or shopping or doing the usual you
    would typical see here in a bigger city. The nightime is what really drew me in. the streets lit up with neon lights
    everywhere and even though im not much of a partier these days, everyone in japan was partying everywhere as alcohol 
    is legal to consume right in the streets and some bars stayed open till the very next day. As I continued to watching
    the streamer daily for about 3 years still to this day, I was fascinated with the artwork, animations, food style and
    just about anything you really wouldn't see around here in our country.

<h2>3 Facts About Japan</h2>

<p2>

<ol>
 <li>
    Pachinko is a very popular type of entertainment similar to a game of western pinball and slot machines. 
    Small steel balls drop a machine and bounce and slide down various paths. 
    Pachinko was invented before world war 2 but it was only after the war it became insanely popular. 
    Each steel ball played with represents approximately 4 yen and players
    drop in thousands of steel balls at a time. 
    Depending on the machine the probability you will hit a jackpot or not may be seen.
    The chances are usually 1/99 or 1/200 per spin.
    There are 2 jackpots one called "ooatari" which is the bigger of the 2 and another called "koatari" (or small jackpot).
    Although it may look like gambling Pachinko is technically not, while gambling in japan is actually illegal, 
    the machines use balls and not money even though you can exchange the balls for money or other prizes
    it seems Pachinko has a loophole.
